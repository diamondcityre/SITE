		      <h1>Dubai drops Dh1 million down payment for Golden Visa eligibility</h1><br>
		      	<p>Government has eased the criteria for real estate investors.The owner can apply for the 10-year residency regardless of the amount paid upfront, an executive explained</p> <br>      
            <p>In a recent update, Dubai's Golden Visa requirements for property buyers have undergone a significant revision, making it more accessible for investors. The previous mandatory minimum down payment of Dh1 million has been eliminated, allowing greater flexibility for potential residents.</p><br>

    <p>Under the revised criteria, property owners looking to secure the Golden Visa can apply for the <b>10-year residency</b> even if the property's value exceeds Dh2 million and they choose a payment plan or mortgage. This adjustment opens up opportunities for a wider range of investors, as the upfront payment amount no longer determines eligibility for the long-term visa.</p><br>

    <p>This change reflects the government's commitment to promoting real estate investment and attracting a diverse pool of international buyers to Dubai. The more inclusive approach aims to stimulate economic growth and further establish Dubai as a global hub for investment and residency.</p><br>

    <p>As always, it is advisable for interested parties to stay updated on any further developments or nuances in the Golden Visa program to ensure accurate and timely information for their investment decisions.</p><br>
    
            <p>The payment plays a big part in the timeline too. If you're a financed seller dealing with a financed buyer, the sale can take approximately <b>8 weeks</b>. For a financed buyer and cash seller or vice versa, the process can take about 6 weeks – while a cash buyer and cash seller would be looking at an estimated <b>1-4 weeks</b>.</p><br>

            <h2>All Golden Visa holders, owners can sponsor their spouses, children and parents for the same 10-year period.</h2><br>

            <p>We Found this news on Khaleej Times that the minimum payment of <b>Dh1 million</b> is no longer required. The eligibility criterion is now only that the property should meet a value of Dh2 million or more for investors to obtain the Golden Visa. <b>"There is no minimum equity investment,".</b></p><br>
            
            <p>Stephenson highlighted a significant shift in Dubai's Golden Visa eligibility, emphasizing that the recent changes make the visa accessible to a broader demographic. </p><br>
            <p>With the removal of the Dh1 million minimum down payment requirement, now anyone with a mortgage can apply for the 10-year residency. According to Stephenson, paying in 20 percent of the property's value, a common practice for mortgage buyers, would render them eligible for the Golden Visa.
            <p>This adjustment is expected to benefit a vast majority of property buyers and end-users, essentially opening up the Golden Visa option to nearly everyone who has invested in a property valued at more than Dh2 million in Dubai.</p><br>
            
            <p>Payment plans for Dubai-based homes range from <b>1 per cent monthly to five- to 25-year </b> schemes after an initial down payment. When it comes to mortgages, up to 80 per cent of property value can be financed.</p><br>
            <p>Meanwhile, the “excellent government initiative” would help boost the property market, <b>“This enables us to have positive conversations with potential clients, especially from overseas, and help them get on the property ladder and obtain a visa even quicker with a minimal investment,”</b> </p> <br>
            <p>“To buy a property worth Dh2 million, but you don’t have to hold equity of the same value is such a great worth. Example “If you buy an off-plan unit, you just need to pay the down payment, which for some is only Dh50,000, and be eligible for a golden visa.”</p><br>
            <p>Before this, investors needed to have equity in the property over a certain value to be eligible for a golden visa</p> <br>
