		<p class="text-center px-md-5">Buying a house is a dream for many and, at the same time, a nightmare. Saving for a down payment, acquiring a mortgage, and locating the perfect property are no easy feats. However, what if owning a home with only 1% monthly payments was possible? Does that sound too good to be true? 
		<br>To begin with, it’s not in Dubai where some developers are giving this enticing payment plan for their properties. In this blog post, we will discuss the 1% payment plan, how it works, and why buying luxury property in Dubai can be a good idea. Let’s get started!

		      <h2>What is a 1% payment plan? </h2>
            <p>The 1% payment plan enables you to buy a dream house in Dubai, paying only 1% monthly of total price. This implies that you don’t need a huge upfront payment, and there are no high-interest rates or charges. You only pay 1% of the property monthly until you own it 100%. For instance, when you buy a million-dirham property, you can be required to pay 10k dirham per month for 100 months, which is approximately eight years. Much better than paying 25% (AED 250,000) and a 3% mortgage interest rate per month (AED 3,735) on a 25-year mortgage.</p>
    <div>        
            <h2>How does the 1% payment plan operate?</h2>
            <p>Some developers in Dubai offer a 1% payment plan to increase the number of buyers and investors interested in their projects. They normally partner with a bank or a financial institution that funds buying.  Typically, Danube Properties offers a convenient 1% payment plan for its off-plan projects.</p>
    </div>
    <p>A buyer signs a contract with the developer and the bank stating they will pay 1% of the ownership monthly. Once the buyers pay 50 % of the property’s price, they also acquire the title deed; this gives them a better sense of security and flexibility. However, this percentage can vary builder to builder. Some property builders apply 25 to 30 percent for title deeds.</p>

    <p>Unlike in a Rent-to-Own situation where one pays rent for some time and then buys the property, in a 1% payment plan, you pay 1% of the total house price per month. The 1% payment plan makes you buy luxury property in Dubai from day one, paying a monthly amount towards the purchase price, not rent.</p>
    
    <h2>Calculating The 1% Rule</h2>
    <p>The 1% rule can be easily calculated. Simply multiply the purchase price of the property by 1%. Place the comma of the purchase price to the right, two lines. You should charge at least what the result indicates as monthly rent.You will also want to add the cost of any repairs needed to the house’s price and multiply the house price by 1%.</p>

            <h2>What is so good about a 1% payment plan?</h2>

            <p>The 1% payment plan has many benefits for buyers who want to buy a property in Dubai, such as</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h5>Affordable</h5>
                    <p>It is only one percent of the monthly property price, much less than Dubai’s average rent and mortgage paymenT.It also saves you interest and closing fees because you pay the property off faster than a conventional mortgage.This opens new investment opportunities in Dubai in the real estate sector.</p>
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <h5>Flexible</h5>
                    <p>There are many properties and locations that you can choose from depending on what your budget and lifestyle allow. Additionally, you can sell or lease your property,provided you clear the balance with a developer and the bank.</p>
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <h5>Security</h5>
                    <p>Once you pay 50% of the price, you get the title deeds, giving you full ownership, and you can use it as collateral for other loans or investments. Secondly, you don’t need to bother about the developer getting broke and delaying the completion of the project as you will deal with the bank funding the purchase.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
